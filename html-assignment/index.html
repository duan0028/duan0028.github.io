      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm <em>Longjian Duan</em>, an enthusiastic international student from China and currently pursuing my studies at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. Pursuing <mark>Interactive Media Design</mark>, I find joy in delving into my chosen field while absorbing the diverse cultural milieu that Canada offers. This experience not only enhances my skills but also fosters a deep appreciation for the unique perspectives and traditions that thrive in this multicultural environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the study realm, I am a <del>avid</del> guitar player, <del>photographer, and chef</del>. I am seeking a balance between my studies and personal interests. As I navigate the enriching journey of being an international student, I am excited about the opportunities for growth, both academically and personally, and look forward to contributing my unique perspective to the rich mosaic of experiences here in <a href="https://canada.ca">Canada</a>.
      </p>
